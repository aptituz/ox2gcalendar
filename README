ox2gcalendar
------------
This is a utility to synchronize OX calendar entries to a google entry.
For example to keep track of business appointments in your private
calendar.

Features
--------
- Configuration in a YAML file
- Configurable number of months that will be scanned for events in the OX calendar
- Masquerading of appointment descriptions with a configurable string

Requirements
------------
This module requires the following perl modules:

DateTime (libdatetime-perl)
Net::OpenXChange (which is unfortunately not public yet)
Net::Google::Calendar
YAML (libyaml-perl)

Configuration
-------------
The script requires a configuration file which stores your login information
for OX and Google. An example can be found in the examples directory.
It must reside at

~/.config/ox2gcalendar/ox2gcalendar.cf

OR

~/ox2gcalendar.cf

Usage
-----
Once you have a configuration file, just execute the program.
You can call it with the option -v to see whats going on or
even -d if you are interested in debugging information.

Bugs
----
The tool currently supports creating and updating entries but
it does not support deleting entries if they get deleted in OX.
